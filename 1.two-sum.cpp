 *
 * Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they
 * add up to a specific target.
 * 
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may
 * not use the same element twice.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
 * 
 * Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
 * return [0, 1].
